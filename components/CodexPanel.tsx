      <div className="text-xs text-white/70">
        <strong>Stories</strong> — Echoes of old embers. Tales that steady the wandering heart.
      </div>

      <div className="text-xs text-white/70">
        <strong>Rituals</strong> — Small acts of courage. Each ritual rekindles a part of the soul; they have cooldowns so the fire may temper your strength.
      </div>

      <div className="text-xs text-white/70">
        <strong>Journal</strong> — Private pages. Your prayers, notes, and quiet thoughts are kept here; nothing leaves unless you export it.
      </div>

      <div className="text-xs text-white/70">
        <strong>Covenant</strong> — A sacred promise made beside the fire. Write a trading-based mission in faded letters — e.g. "I will not be greedy; I will trade with wisdom." When you type, the prompt disappears; your covenant is recorded.
      </div>

      <div className="text-xs text-white/70">
        <strong>Memory</strong> — The fire remembers whispers and keeps your recent moments. It is your progress mirror.
      </div>

      <div className="text-xs text-white/70">
        <strong>Blessings</strong> — Rewards from the fire for faithful acts (rest, rituals, covenant, divine moments). They add warmth and unlock gentle favors.
      </div>

      <div className="text-xs text-white/70">
        <strong>Badges</strong> — Tokens of your path. Each is a quiet mark of a lesson learned.
      </div>

      <div className="text-xs text-white/70">
        <strong>Ascension</strong> — When Inner Warmth reaches the threshold, the fire will lift you; you may export your Pilgrim's Chronicle and carry the golden flame.
      </div>

      <div className="mt-2 text-xs text-white/60 italic">
        Tip: Use <strong>Call the Spirit</strong> for momentary guidance. The fire whispers once each minute, watching over your path.
